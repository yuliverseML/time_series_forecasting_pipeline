# Time Series Sales Forecasting

A comprehensive Python solution for sales forecasting using multiple time series forecasting approaches.

## Overview

This project implements an end-to-end pipeline for sales forecasting, comparing three popular methods: Facebook Prophet, XGBoost, and SARIMAX. The solution includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, visualization, and a deployment-ready API.

- **Rich Visualizations**: Time series plots, seasonality analysis, model comparisons, residual diagnostics
- **Model Explainability**: Feature importance analysis and model diagnostics
- **Production-Ready API**: Flask-based REST API with proper error handling and logging
- **Best Practices**: Proper train/test splitting, scaling, model persistence, and metadata tracking

## Requirements

```
python>=3.7
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
xgboost
prophet
statsmodels
flask
joblib
```

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sales-forecasting.git
cd sales-forecasting
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data Requirements

The code expects a CSV file named `sales_data.csv` with at least two columns:
- `date`: Date in a format parsable by pandas (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD)
- `sales`: Numeric values representing sales figures

Additional columns can be present and may be used as external regressors.

## Usage

### Running the Full Pipeline

To execute the complete forecasting pipeline:

```bash
python sales_forecast.py
```

This will:
1. Load and preprocess the data
2. Generate exploratory visualizations
3. Train and evaluate three forecasting models
4. Save the models and visualizations
5. Start the prediction API server

### Using the API

Once the server is running, you can make predictions via HTTP requests:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/predict \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "date": "2023-01-15",
    "previous_day_sales": 1200,
    "previous_week_sales": 1150,
    "previous_2week_sales": 1100,
    "previous_month_sales": 1050,
    "rolling_mean_7": 1125,
    "rolling_std_7": 75,
    "rolling_min_7": 1000,
    "rolling_max_7": 1300,
    "rolling_mean_14": 1100,
    "rolling_mean_30": 1075,
    "pct_change": 0.02,
    "pct_change_7": 0.05
  }'
```

To check the API health:
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/health
```

To retrieve model metrics:
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/metrics
```

## Pipeline Steps

1. **Data Collection and Preparation**
   - Loading data from CSV
   - Exploratory data analysis
   - Visualization of time series and seasonality
   - Handling missing values and duplicates

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Time-based features (day of week, month, etc.)
   - Lag features (previous periods)
   - Rolling window statistics (mean, std, min, max)
   - Momentum features (percentage changes)

3. **Model Training**
   - Prophet with yearly, weekly, and custom seasonality
   - XGBoost with optimized hyperparameters
   - SARIMAX with appropriate orders and seasonal components

4. **Model Evaluation and Analysis**
   - Multiple metrics calculation (RMSE, MAE, MAPE, R²)
   - Visualization of predictions vs. actual values
   - Residual analysis
   - Feature importance analysis
   - Time series cross-validation

5. **Deployment**
   - Model persistence
   - REST API implementation
   - Input validation and error handling
   - Logging system

## Customization

### Adjusting the Train/Test Split
Modify the following line to change the split ratio:
```python
cutoff_date = data['date'].min() + timedelta(days=int(total_days * 0.8))  # 0.8 = 80% training
```

### Adding New Features
Add new features in the feature engineering section:
```python
# Example: Add new feature
data['is_holiday'] = (data['date'].isin(holiday_dates)).astype(int)
```

### Changing Model Parameters
Adjust hyperparameters in the model training sections:
```python
# Example: Change XGBoost parameters
best_params = {
    'eta': 0.01,  # Learning rate
    'max_depth': 6,
    # Other parameters...
}
```

## Best Practices and Considerations

1. **Data Quality**:
   - Ensure sufficient historical data (at least 2x the forecast horizon)
   - Check for and handle outliers
   - Be aware of data collection methodology changes

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Consider external factors (holidays, promotions, economic indicators)
   - Domain knowledge is crucial for creating effective features
   - Be cautious of data leakage in feature creation

3. **Model Selection**:
   - Different models excel at capturing different patterns
   - Prophet works well with strong seasonality
   - XGBoost handles complex feature interactions
   - SARIMAX is good for traditional time series patterns

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Always evaluate on a proper holdout set
   - Consider the business impact of errors, not just metrics
   - Visualize predictions to spot systematic errors

5. **Production Deployment**:
   - Implement a retraining strategy
   - Monitor model drift
   - Have fallback prediction mechanisms
